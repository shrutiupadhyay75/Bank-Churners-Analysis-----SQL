# Customer Attrition Analysis-----SQL

## Objective
The main goal of this project is to analyze customer data to predict which customers are likely to leave the bank. By identifying these at-risk customers, we can take steps to offer them better services and encourage them to stay.

## Overview
This project involves analyzing data from 10,000 customers, considering 21 different factors such as age, salary, marital status, credit card limit, and credit card category. The analysis aims to identify key trends and predictors of customer attrition.

## Key Factors Analyzed
1. Customer's Age
2. Income Category
3. Gender
4. Tenure of Relationship with Bank
5. Marital Status
6. Education Level
7. Average Utilization

## Findings and Insights

1. **Age Group Analysis:**
   - The highest number of attriting customers are in the age range of 40-50 years, followed by 50-60 years.
   
2. **Age Comparison:**
   - The average age of both existing and attriting customers is around 46 years, with almost no difference between males and females.

3. **Gender Analysis:**
   - There are more females than males among both existing and attriting customers.
   - Female customers are more likely to attrite compared to male customers.

4. **Education Level:**
   - Customers with a 'Doctorate' or 'Postgraduate' degree have a significantly higher attrition rate compared to existing customers.

5. **Marital Status:**
   - The highest attrition rate is among customers who are married.

6. **Tenure Analysis:**
   - Customers who have been with the bank for 30-40 months have the highest attrition rate, followed by those with 40-50 months of tenure. Focus should be placed on customers in the 20-30 months range to prevent future attrition.

7. **Utilization Rate:**
   - Lower utilization of the credit card is associated with a higher likelihood of attrition.
